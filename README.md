# learning_x11

Experiments on drawing a rotating 3D mesh with X11 (XQuartz).

The goal of these experiments is to draw a polygon mesh and then rotating it.  
The faces should be read from a text file, and the rotation should be along a random axis, possibly changing over time.


## Tools to be used

- My personal intuition
- C
- X11 library and runtime
- vim
- bash
- git
- ?


## Previous knowledge

- Some C
- Some vim
- Some bash
- Some git
- Some Math and Linear Algebra concepts I learnt in High School and University
- Reminiscence of general concepts around 3D meshes from one or two CS courses


## Additional constraints

- Online resources on a specific task should be checked only when stuck on that task


## Expectations

Low.


## Chances of abandonment

To the roof.


## Motivation

I dropped out of my PhD 16 days ago without plan B, and I still haven't gotten off my couch (and Telegram).
